# File Integrity Tool
This is a File Integrity Tool which hashes all files in a directory and iteratively checks for updates on these hashes. If any changes are made, the File Integrity Tool displays which file hash has been changed. This means that the integrity of your files stays secure and a user is updated when a file is changed. This can be an authorized or unauthorized change. 

**CAUTIONS & WARNINGS:**
- Make sure to limit write privileges to FIM.py Because the FIM has to be run with elevated privileges. Code could be modified and run as root.
